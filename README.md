This repository contains the files related to Will Dawson's 2012 paper:
["The Dynamics of Merging Clusters: A Monte Carlo Solution Applied to the Bullet and Musket Ball Clusters"](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1210.0014D)

Pyton code implementing the discussed Monte Carlo method is openly available [here](git://github.com/MCTwo/MCMAC.git).
