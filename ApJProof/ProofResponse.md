Requests:

  1. Please move figures 10-16 to Appendix C.  These figures are not critical to the body of the text and will not be of interest to the general reader. They can be moved to Appendix C as reference for the interested reader. See for example the Appendix of High, F.W. et al., 2012. Weak-Lensing Mass Measurements of Five Galaxy Clusters in the South Pole Telescope Survey Using Magellan/Megacam. ApJ, 758, 68, 2012.  If you need to rescale these figures slightly so that they better fit on the page that should be fine, or so that you can fit more than one figure on a page.
  2. Similarly please move figures 17-22 to Appendix D.
  3. Perhaps move figures 3 & 4 to a separate page from figure 5-7, just so that there isn't a block of figures taking up a whole page. There should be plenty of room to better incorporate these figures with the text of the article after moving figures 10-16 and 17-22 to the appendices.
  4. The M_1 circle of Figure 1 appears disjointed in the proof.  The eps figure does not appear this way, nor does this the figure appear disjointed when I build the pdf.  Please see if this can be fixed.  If you need me to try sending you a new eps for png file just let me know.

Response to ApJ Queries:

1. This was cited out of order because Figure 15 should be in Appendix C.  If this goes against guidelines then you can replace the reference to Figure 15 with a reference to Appendix C.
2. The J. Bullock, private communication reference year is 2012
3. There is no update as of yet.
4. 
  * Please replace the 2nd sentence of Appendix C with:  For ease of display the parameters are grouped in three categories (Input, Geometry, and Velocity & Time) resulting in a six subplot results array, see Figure 10. The six subplots of the Bullet Cluster results array are shown in Figures 11-16.
  * Please replace the 1st sentence of Appendix D with:  This section contains the parameter results array plots for the Musket Ball Cluster, Figures 17-22.
5. Checked and addressed in the following queries
6. I am not sure of the specific publisher details (it is not avaialbe in ADS).  My best guess of the publisher is the European Space Agnecy. It may be just online proceedings: http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_science/workshops/x-ray-symposium/
7. \bibitem[Mroczkowski et al.(2012)]{2012ApJ...761...47M} Mroczkowski, T., Dicker, S., Sayers, J., et al.\ 2012, \apj, 761, 47
8. This error was due to improper formatting in the bibtex entry of ADS, please use:
  * \bibitem[Newman et al.(2012)]{2012arXiv1203.3192N} Newman, J.~A., Cooper, M.~C., Davis, M., et al.\ 2012, arXiv:1203.3192
9. This is correct.


Given the extent of the requested corrections I would like to view the second proof before the article is published. Thank you for your thorough review.
